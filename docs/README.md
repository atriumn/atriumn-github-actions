## Architecture Overview

### Issue Management Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Issue Comment] --> B[handle-issue-commands]
    B --> C{Command Type}
    C -->|/start| D[create-issue-branch]
    C -->|/ready| E[update-issue-status]
    C -->|/done| E
    D --> F[New Branch Created]
    E --> G[Status Updated]
```

### Action Integration

These composite actions work together to create an automated development workflow:

1. **Issue Creation**: Developer creates an issue describing work
2. **Start Work**: `/start` command triggers branch creation
3. **Development**: Work proceeds on feature branch
4. **Status Updates**: Commands update issue status throughout
5. **Completion**: PR merged and issue closed automatically

## Best Practices

### Action Design
- Keep actions focused on a single responsibility
- Provide clear, descriptive names
- Document all inputs and outputs
- Include usage examples
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Testing
- Write tests for all new actions
- Use GitHub Actions workflow files for testing
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Validate input handling

### Documentation
- Keep README files up to date
- Include practical examples
- Document any limitations
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
